# Build:

- cmake flame

- regsvr32 msdia**.dll in visual studio's dia sdk i.e. "vs_path/DIA SDK/bin/amd64"

- build typeinfogen first (in debug config)

- build compiler

- run renderpath/canvas/compile_debug.bat

- build other porjects
  
- enjoy

PS1: if you want to build in release confin, always build in RelWithDebInfo, because DebugInfo is always needed
PS2: if any strange errors were generated by typeinfogen, you can try to delete and remake that pdb and try again
